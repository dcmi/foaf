# foaf

This is a 2015 reflection of the main FOAF project Subversion repository into Github.

Historically we had two repos: foaf/ which was the core specs, and foaftown/ which was a more random scratchpad.

We aim to ultimately treat this git repo as primary, and the svn as either frozen or (if someone does the work) something that can be sync'd with latest state of git master branch. However at the time of writing (2017) it is not 100% validated as fully representing the full history and most recent edits of our work.
